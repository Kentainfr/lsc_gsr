Have you always wanted to have a GunShot Residue (GSR) on your server ?

Now itâ€™s possible and free!

Made with some buddies of mine we decided to release it for free after heavy testing with ~100 players.

Enjoy!

Script requires ox_lib for notification / ox_target to use the item / ox_inventory for the required items

First time making a config.lua as well so not very familiar with it, if there is any issue please let me know !
