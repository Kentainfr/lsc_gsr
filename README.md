A simple GSR script for FiveM using ox_lib &amp; ox_target &amp; ox_inventory


I've been tired of searching and searching for a good and free GSR scripts. Decided to make one, got help from some buddy on discord I only did the ox parts. Used on a average of 100 players server with no issue. Have fun! If there is issue do a pull requests or send me a message on cfx.
